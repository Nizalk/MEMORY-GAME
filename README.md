# MEMORY-GAME
A kid game to devellop the abilitie of remebering

The memory game, or concentration, as it is sometimes called, is a popular card game played by children and adults around the world. Good memory is one of the qualities 
required in order to succeed in it. This, however, is not enough. When it is assumed that the players have perfect memory, the memory game can be seen as a game of 
strategy. The game is analysed under this assumption and the optimal strategy is found. It is simple and perhaps unexpected.
